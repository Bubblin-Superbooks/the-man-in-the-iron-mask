I command this man, and he bores me, <em>mordioux!</em> Come, let us have a shot or two at the rabbits; the walk will be beautiful, and not fatiguing. The whole island is but a league and a half in length, with the breadth of a league; a real park. Let us try to amuse ourselves.”</p><p>“As you please, D’Artagnan; not for the sake of amusing ourselves, but to gain an opportunity for talking freely.”</p><p>D’Artagnan made a sign to a soldier, who brought the gentlemen some guns, and then returned to the fort.</p><p>“And now,” said the musketeer, “answer me the question put to you by that black-looking Saint-Mars: what did you come to do at the Lerin Isles?”</p><p>“To bid you farewell.”</p></div> </div>
