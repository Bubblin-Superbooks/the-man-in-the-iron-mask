Well, sire?”</p><p>“In such a fashion that he may not, on the road, either converse with any one or throw notes to people he may meet.”</p><p>“That will be rather difficult, sire.”</p><p>“Not at all.”</p><p>“Pardon me, sire, I cannot stifle M. Fouquet, and if he asks for liberty to breathe, I cannot prevent him by closing both the windows and the blinds. He will throw out at the doors all the cries and notes possible.”</p><p>“The case is provided for, Monsieur d’Artagnan; a carriage with a trellis will obviate both the difficulties you point out.”</p><p>“A carriage with an iron trellis!” cried D’Artagnan; “but a carriage with an iron trellis is not made in half an hour, and your majesty commands me to go immediately to M. Fouquet’s lodgings.”</p><p>“The carriage in question is already made.”</p></div> </div>
