He who dies, gains; he who sees others die, loses.

A Christian gentleman ought not to curse his God, D’Artagnan; it is enough to once have cursed a king!”</p><p>“Humph!” sighed D’Artagnan, a little confused by this violent tempest of grief.</p><p>“Let me speak to him, Athos. Who knows?”</p><p>“Try, if you please, but I am convinced you will not succeed.”</p></div> </div>
