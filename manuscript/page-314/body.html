An admirable trio of friends, don’t you think so? What an affecting relic of the former dear old times!”</p><p>“I can only tell you one thing, D’Artagnan, and I swear it on the Bible: I love you just as I used to do. If I ever suspect you, it is on account of others, and not on account of either of us. In everything I may do, and should happen to succeed in, you will find your fourth. Will you promise me the same favor?”</p><p>“If I am not mistaken, Aramis, your words—at the moment you pronounce them—are full of generous feeling.”</p><p>“Such a thing is very possible.”</p><p>“You are conspiring against M. Colbert. If that be all, <em>mordioux</em>, tell me so at once. I have the instrument in my own hand, and will pull out the tooth easily enough.”</p></div> </div>
