The disappearance of all the fishing-boats that went out two days ago is not an ordinary circumstance. There has been no storm at sea; the weather has been constantly calm, not even the lightest gale; and even if we had had a tempest, all our boats would not have foundered. I repeat, it is strange. This complete disappearance astonishes me, I tell you.”</p><p>“True,” murmured Aramis. “You are right, friend Porthos; it is true, there is something strange in it.”</p></div> </div>
