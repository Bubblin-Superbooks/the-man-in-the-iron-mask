It seemed to him that the voice of the bishop’s, but just now so playful and gay, had become funereal and sad; that the wax lights changed into the tapers of a mortuary chapel, the very glasses of wine into chalices of blood.</p><p>Aramis took a pen and wrote. Baisemeaux, in terror, read over his shoulder.</p><p>“A. M. D. G.,” wrote the bishop; and he drew a cross under these four letters, which signify <em>ad majorem Dei gloriam</em>, “to the greater glory of God;” and thus he continued: “It is our pleasure that the order brought to M. de Baisemeaux de Montlezun, governor, for the king, of the castle of the Bastile, be held by him good and effectual, and be immediately carried into operation.”</p><p>(Signed) D’HERBLAY</p><p>“General of the Order, by the grace of God.”</p></div> </div>
