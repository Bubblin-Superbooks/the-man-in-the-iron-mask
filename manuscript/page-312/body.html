What suspicion can you have possibly got hold of?”</p><p>“Do you believe in my instinctive feelings? Formerly you used to have faith in them. Well, then, an instinct tells me that you have some concealed project on foot.”</p><p>“I—a project?”</p><p>“I am convinced of it.”</p><p>“What nonsense!”</p><p>“I am not only sure of it, but I would even swear it.”</p><p>“Indeed, D’Artagnan, you cause me the greatest pain. Is it likely, if I have any project in hand that I ought to keep secret from you, I should tell you about it? If I had one that I could and ought to have revealed, should I not have long ago divulged it?”</p><p>“No, Aramis, no. There are certain projects which are never revealed until the favorable opportunity arrives.”</p></div> </div>
