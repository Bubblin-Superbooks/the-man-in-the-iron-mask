You rhyme in a slovenly manner.”</p><p>“Oh, oh, you think so, do you, Pelisson?”</p><p>“Yes, I do, indeed. Remember that a rhyme is never good so long as one can find a better.”</p><p>“Then I will never write anything again save in prose,” said La Fontaine, who had taken up Pelisson’s reproach in earnest. “Ah!
