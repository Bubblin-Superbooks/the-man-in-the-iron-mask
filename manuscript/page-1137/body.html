The Duc de Beaufort wrote to Athos. The letter destined for the living only reached the dead. God had changed the address.</p></blockquote><p>“MY DEAR COMTE,” wrote the prince, in his large, school-boy’s hand,—“a great misfortune has struck us amidst a great triumph. The king loses one of the bravest of soldiers. I lose a friend. You lose M. de Bragelonne. He has died gloriously, so gloriously that I have not the strength to weep as I could wish. Receive my sad compliments, my dear comte. Heaven distributes trials according to the greatness of our hearts. This is an immense one, but not above your courage. Your good friend,</p><p>“LE DUC DE BEAUFORT.”</p></div> </div>
